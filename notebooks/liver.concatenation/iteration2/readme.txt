This was the second iteration I tried, which was just filtering for genes and cells (based on counts), log1p + normalization, combat, and then clustering. I do not filter cells for high %mito nor filter genes for those that are highly variable. From the clustering, I then remove cells that seem low-quality or artifactual. This is a pretty simple processing and yields very good results, keeping all the cell types we believe to be truly distinct cells.
